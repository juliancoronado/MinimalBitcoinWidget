# Minimal Bitcoin Widget

Built with Flutter 3.16.9

A minimal Bitcoin price widget for your home screen!

The widget conforms to your current system device theme and you can select which currency to view the price in (USD, GBP, EUR, MXN, and AUD).

Price information provided by CoinGecko.

New features will be added as I work on them! Thank you for the support!
